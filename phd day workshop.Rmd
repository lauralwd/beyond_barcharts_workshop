# Bar chart alternatives

Let's meet the iris dataset!
Read more about it in the R help page for iris

```{r}
head(iris)
```

## ggplot basics

Let's do ggplot basics now!

Make a jitterplot with `geom_jitter()` Set the `x aesthetic` to `Species` and the `y aesthetic` to `Sepal.Length`

```{r}

```

## Barchart in ggplot

Let's make the same plot, but as a barchart.
Do you already know `stat_summary()`?
It's ggplot's best kept secret.
Replace `geom_jitter()` with `stat_summary(geom = 'bar')` and make a barchart.

Second, add `stat_summary(geom = 'errorbar')`

```{r}

```

That's your barchart right there!
Is it a beauty, no not quite, but we can fine-tune that in a later stage.

## Density alternatives

Let's make a couple alternatives.

### try `geom_violin()`

```{r}

```

### try `geom_density`

Replace the `x` aesthetic for `col = Species` , and maybe swap x and y axes.

You can add the `linetype` aesthetic as well!
that way it works in greyscale print.

```{r}

```

-------====== Wait here please, we'll plenary get up to speed in a second ===========------

## point/count alternatives

### dotplot

Similar to a violin plot, but shows the actual data points.
Use `geom_dotplot(binaxis = 'y',stackdir = 'center')`

```{r}

```

### histogram

```{r}

```

### boxplot

```{r}

```

-------====== Wait here please, we'll plenary get up to speed in a second ===========------

# Combining shapes!

ggplot can layer shapes on top of one another.
We can use this to our advantage, and add more data in our figure.

### Boxplot with jitter

Make a boxplot like before, but add the datapoints with `geom_jitter`.
Make the datapoints transparent and grey if you know how.

```{r}

```

### dotplot with median

Was that too easy, then here is a hard one!

Next, make a dotplot, but add a red line that displays the median.
Use stat summary and the cheatsheet.

*hint: `stat_summary()` has a `fun=` argument for determining what function you want used to summarise the data.*

```{r}

```

# Extension packages

## GGdist

ggdist, deals with displaying distributions, perfect!
Have a look at their cheatsheet.
[ggdist cheatsheet](https://github.com/mjskay/ggdist/blob/master/figures-source/cheat_sheet-slabinterval.pdf){.uri}

Try a ggdist visualisation on the iris dataset.

```{r}

```

# A figure of your own?

Do you have a (barchart?) figure of your own at hand?
Maybe play with that!
I'll be around to help out.

```{r}

```

## Alternative:

Formatting your data into the right shape is as hard as working ggplot itself.
I'd like you to try to make a boxplot of the irisdataset.
On the x axis, should be the different lengths that were measured.
The fill colour should be the Species, and on the y axis the actual measured length.
Can you manage?

Now make your favourite alternative, maybe a dotplot with a crossbar?
Or some other shape you may have found in the ggdist package.

```{r}

```

## Challenge!

Feeling up to a challenge, try to re-create this:
